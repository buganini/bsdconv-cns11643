#by design, it's mutually exclusive with ascii (each ascii characters has it's own definition in CNS11643)
#but in implementation, ascii characters appers in ASCII,
#so you should use ascii,_cns11643 for decoding,
#and ascii,_cns11643 for encoding,
#or use cns11643 directly in both decoding and encoding, they are properly associated aliases.
#by design, to/_CNS11643 should only output plane switching sequence when needed,
#but in implementation, it appears all the time.
